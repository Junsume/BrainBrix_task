# Project Overview

This repository contains multiple projects demonstrating different applications built with Python. Currently, it includes the following branches:

## Branches

### 1. `todo_app`
This branch features two implementations of a Todo application:
- **PostgreSQL Todo App**: A Todo application that uses PostgreSQL as the database.

Both implementations allow users to create, read, update, and delete todo items, with support for sorting and pagination.
